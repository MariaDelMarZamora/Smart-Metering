Research suggests that its influence is largely underdetected, with recipients widely underestimating its impact. Consequently, behavioral changes induced by normative information should be perceived as intrinsically motivated. This hypothesis was tested with a commitment-making procedure, where intrinsically motivated commitments tend to produce relatively long-term behavioral changes and extrinsically motivated commitments tend to produce relatively short-term changes. In a field experiment, 8876 households under drought restrictions were randomly assigned to receive restriction information, a strong warning, or normative information communicating community compliance to restrictions. Subsets of households in the latter two conditions were asked to commit to adhering to water restrictions. Immediate reductions were evidenced for committers that received either a strong warning or normative information, but only committers that received normative information showed longer-term reductions in water use. These findings support the claim that normative influence's underdetected nature promotes intrinsic motivation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Commitment-making; Social norms; Water conservation",,,,,,"DUE-1239797, NSF, National Science Foundation","Funding for this research was provided by the Olivenhain Municipal Water District and by a grant from the National Science Foundation (DUE-1239797).

On the real estate market, it was expected that an energy label, rating the energy performance of a property based on a national energy performance certificate (EPC) might receive similar response. However, in Denmark no response to the energy performance rating was observed for 15 years. This was a surprise considering that Denmark was the first country to implement an A to G rating of the energy performance of buildings. A statistical examination of data on property sales prices and energy performance ratings was carried out. All relevant property transaction data from 2007 till 2012 were examined and they showed that energy performance ratings had an impact on property sales prices. However, before June 2010, the impact was modest, whereas after June 2010 the impact of energy performance ratings on property sales prices increased significantly as a result of an EU requirement to display the energy performance rating in connection with property sales. On this background, it was concluded that a public display of the energy performance rating is fundamental for market response. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy label; Energy label advertisement; Energy performance certificate; Energy performance rating; Real estate prices","Commerce; Costs; Labels; Rating; Sales; Energy labels; Energy performance; Energy performance of buildings; Energy-efficient products; Market response; Real estate market; Real estate prices; Transaction data; Energy efficiency; energy efficiency; energy market; marketing; performance assessment; price dynamics; property market; Denmark",,,,,,,"Backhaus, J., Tigchelaar, C., de Best-Waldhober, B., Key Findings & Policy Recommendations to Improve Effectiveness of Energy Performance Certificates & the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2011), IDEAL EPBD; Brounen, D., Kok, N., On the economics of energy labels in the housing market (2011) J.

Each household's actual water consumption was measured at baseline (pre-intervention), in the short-term (1 week post intervention) and the long term (4 weeks post-intervention). The results of the study indicated that for high water consumers at baseline, the knowledge deficit approach resulted in a more water consumption than the other three conditions in the short term and long term. These results imply that the social norms, social identity, or personal identity approaches provided more promising avenues to encourage water conservation than the knowledge deficit approach.

The label should enable consumers to purchase energy-friendly products (i.e., products with low energy consumption), thereby making a significant contribution to the reduction of overall energy consumption. This paper offers a systematic analysis of consumers' interpretation of the energy label. The results of a set of experimental studies revealed that consumers tend to base their estimates of a product's energy consumption mainly on the energy efficiency class (e.g., A) communicated on the energy label and largely ignore information about annual electricity consumption (e.g., 120 kWh/year). Thereby, consumers potentially overestimate the energy friendliness of a product assigned a high energy efficiency rating. This also holds true when consumers directly compare two products in terms of energy friendliness. Thus, participants chose a higher-consuming product because it had a high energy efficiency rating. High energy efficiency ratings (e.g., A+++) can distort consumers' perceptions of product categories that consume excessively (e.g., freezers). Participants were seduced into thinking that a high energy efficiency rating (e.g., A++) means the energy consumption of energy hogs is no longer problematic. This paper provides evidence that the energy label could have a contrary effect than the one intended due to people's susceptibility to an energy efficiency fallacy. This misinterpretation of the energy label could further explain why overall energy demand is increasing despite enhanced energy efficiency. Finally, implications for policy makers and further research for enhancement of the energy label are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluate these motivations in the lightbulb market using a theoretical model and two randomized experiments. We derive welfare effects as functions of reduced-form sufficient statistics capturing economic and psychological parameters, which we estimate using a novel within-subject information disclosure experiment. The main results suggest that moderate subsidies for energy-efficient lightbulbs may increase welfare, but informational and attentional biases alone do not justify a ban on incandescent lightbulbs.

While the application of behavior-based method is promising, the challenge exists to achieve efficiently sustainable behavioral change. Based on multi-period observation of energy behavior at the Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, this paper presents a model-based approach aimed to improve the nationally popular and deep-seated benchmark setting strategy for normative feedback used in home energy reports. The improved approach has its merits of countering the undesirable boomerang effect and enhancing the effectiveness of normative feedback targeting different personalities. By introducing a modified opinion dynamics model, this paper simulates the process of energy behavior change and therefore identifies the driver and elementary rules of behavioral change. In particular, the paper defines various behavioral zones in accordance with people's personality and proposes a new customized energy reporting mechanism that maps normative benchmark to personality trait. The new energy reporting policy has strong industrial implication for promoting behavior-based method towards a sustained energy conservation movement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy behavior; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Normative feedback; Opinion dynamics model; Personality trait","Behavioral research; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Behavior-based methods; Cost-effective solutions; Energy behavior; Home energy reports; Model based approach; Opinion dynamics; Personality traits; Reporting mechanisms; Energy efficiency; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy policy; numerical model; Maryland; United States",,,,,"71201087, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China; 2012BAC13B05; 71171143, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China","Meng Shen would like to thank the National Science and Technology Supporting Program of China (Grant no. 2012BAC13B05 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71171143 ) and National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Project (Grant no. 71201087 ) for supporting this research.","Abrahamse, W., Steg, L., Vlek, C., Rothengatter, T., A review of intervention studies aimed at household energy conservation (2005) J.

We present evidence from a Northern Illinois goal-setting program, aimed at reducing residential electricity consumption, which is difficult to reconcile with standard preferences and is broadly consistent with a model of present-biased consumers with reference-dependent preferences. We find that the need for commitment is correlated with program adoption, higher pre-adoption consumption, and lower responsiveness to goals. Consumers choosing realistic goals persistently save substantially more, achieving savings of nearly 11%, than those choosing very low or unrealistically high goals. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Energy conservation; Goal-setting; Reference dependence; Self-control",,,,,,,,"Abeler, J., Falk, A., Goette, L., Huffman, D., Reference points and effort provision (2011) Am.

On this backcloth, there is currently increasing interest in recommendations from behavioural economics focusing on making the choice architecture more facilitating for the desired behaviour. The authors present three studies demonstrating how mental shortcuts, based on subtle cues in the context, unconsciously influence human decision-making, with important consequences for the environment. Two of our own studies illustrate the behavioural impacts of (a) anchoring (the design of the European energy label) and (b) default effect (the framing of a request to participate in the Smart Grid), and data from Göckeritz et al. (Eur J Soc Psych 40:514-523, 2010) are used to illustrate the impacts of (c) herding or descriptive norms (the social context of energy saving). The authors end by pointing at theoretical weaknesses in behavioural economics and calling for research to strengthening the theoretical underpinnings of this approach to behaviour change. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy labelling; Energy saving; Environmental policy; Information; Nudging; Smart Grid",,,,,,,,"Abrahamse, W., Steg, L., Vlek, C., Rothengatter, T., A review of intervention studies aimed at household energy conservation (2005) Journal of Environmental Psychology, 25, pp. 273-291; Allcott, H., Social norms and energy conservation (2011) Journal of Public Economy, 95, pp. 1082-1095; Anderson, C.J., The psychology of doing nothing: forms of decision avoidance result from reason and emotion (2003) Psychological Bulletin, 129, pp. 139-166; (2007) Warning: too much information can harm, , The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, London; Biel, A., Thøgersen, J., Activation of social norms in social dilemmas: a review of the evidence and reflections on the implications for environmental behaviour (2007) Journal of Economic Psychology, 28, pp. 93-112; Brennan, T., Consumer preference not to choose: methodological and policy implications (2006) RFF Discussion Paper 05-51, , Washington DC: Resources for the Future (RFF; Brown, C.L., Krishna, A., The skeptical shopper: a metacognitive account for the effects of default options on choice (2004) Journal of Consumer Research, 31, pp. 529-539; Camerer, C., Loewenstein, G., Rabin, M., (2003) Advances in behavioral economics, , (eds), Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Chaiken, S., Trope, Y., (1999) Dual-process theories in social psychology, , Guilford Press, New York; Cialdini, R.B., Descriptive social norms as underappreciated sources of social control (2007) Psychometrika, 72, pp. 263-268; Cialdini, R.B., Reno, R.R., Kallgren, C.A., A focus theory of normative conduct: recycling the concept of norms to reduce littering in public places (1990) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 58, pp. 1015-1026; Cialdini, R.B., Demaine, L.J., Sagarin, B.J., Barrett, D.W., Rhoads, K., Winter, P.L., Managing social norms for persuasive impact (2006) Social Influence, 1, pp. 3-15; Dinner, I., Johnson, E.J., Goldstein, D.G., Liu, K., Partitioning default effects: why people choose not to choose (2011) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 17, pp. 332-341; Dolan, P., Metcalfe, R., (2011) Better neighbors and basic knowledge: a field experiment on the role of non-pecuniary incentives on energy consumption, , University of Oxford, Merton College, Oxford; Dolan, P., Hallsworth, M., Halpern, D., King, D., Metcalfe, R., Vlaev, I., Influencing behaviour: the mindspace way (2012) J Econ Psychol, 33, pp. 264-277; Egan, C., Waide, P., A multi-country comparative evaluation of labelling research.

We partner with a metropolitan water utility to implement a natural field experiment to examine the effect of such messages on residential water demand. The data, drawn from more than 100,000 households, indicate that social comparison messages had a greater influence on behavior than simple prosocial messages or technical information alone. Moreover, our data suggest that social comparison messages are most effective among households identified as the least price sensitive: high users. Yet the effectiveness of such messages wanes over time. Our results thus highlight important complementarities between pecuniary and nonpecuniary strategies. © 2013 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,,,,,,,,"Allcott, H., Social Norms and Energy Conservation (2011) Journal of Public Economics, 95, pp. 1082-1095; Ayres, I., Raseman, S., Shih, A., Evidence from Two Large Field Experiments That Peer Comparison Feedback Can Reduce Residential Energy Usage (2009) NBER working paper 15386; Becker, G.S., A Theory of the Allocation of Time (1965) Economic Journal, 75, pp. 493-517; Bryan, J.H., Test, M.A., Models of Helping: Naturalistic Studies in Aiding Behavior (1967) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 6, pp. 400-407; Cialdini, R.B., Demaine, L.J., Sagarin, B.J., Barrett, D.W., Rhoads, K., Winter, P.L., Managing Social Norms for Persuasive Impact (2006) Social Influence, 1, pp. 3-15; Costa, D.L., Kahn, M.E., Energy Conservation 'Nudges' and Environmentalist Ideology: Evidence from a Randomized Residential Electricity Field Experiment (2010) NBER working paper 15939; Croson, R., Shang, J., The Impact of Downward Social Information on Contribution Decisions (2008) Experimental Economics, 11, pp. 221-233; Curtis, K., Price, M.K., Reputation or Reciprocity: Gift Exchange in a Labor Market Field Experiment (2009) University of Tennessee, Knoxville, working paper; Frey, B., Meier, S., Social Comparisons and Pro-Social Behavior: Testing 'Conditional Cooperation' in a Field Experiment (2004) American Economic Review, 94, pp. 1717-1722; Gneezy, U., List, J.A., Putting Behavioral Economics to Work: Testing for Gift Exchange in Labor Markets Using Field Experiments (2006) Econometrica, 74, pp. 1365-1384; Goldstein, N.J., Cialdini, R.B., Griskevicius, V., A Room with a Viewpoint: Using Social Norms to Motivate Environmental Conservation in Hotels (2008) Journal of Consumer Research, 35, pp. 472-482; Harrison, G.W., List, J.A., Field Experiments (2004) Journal of Economic Literature, 42, pp. 1009-1055; Hirst, E., Grady, S., Evaluation of a Wisconsin Utility Home Energy Audit Program (1982) Journal of Environmental Systems, 12, pp. 303-320; Hutton, R.B., McNeill, D.L., The Value of Incentives in Stimulating Energy Conservation (1981) Journal of Consumer Research, 8, pp. 291-298; Kurz, T., Donaghue, N., Walker, I., Utilizing a Social-Ecological Framework to Promote Water and Energy Conservation: A Field Experiment (2005) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 35, pp. 1281-1300; Landry, C.E., Lange, A., List, J.A., Price, M.K., Rupp, N.G., Is a Donor in Hand Better Than Two in the Bush: Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment (2010) American Economic Review, 100, pp. 958-983; Levitt, S., List, J.A., What Do Laboratory Experiments Measuring Social Preferences Reveal about the Real World?

Twenty student-households were provided with direct feedback and an online platform with energy feedback over time, ranking of the competing teams, tips and a game. The study showed that the game context strongly influenced the motivation to save energy. Overall, savings averaged 24%, with the highest savings level at 45%. Directly after completion of the Energy Battle, energy consumption increased among most of the households, although consumption levels tended to stay below the baseline measurement level taken before the Energy Battle. Follow-up interviews indicated that some of the behaviours developed in the game had transformed into habits. A game such as the Energy Battle appears to provide a powerful means to stimulate energy saving in the short term. The potential to achieve long term effects appears possible, however further research is required to understand long-term implications for an Energy Battle game.

From the results obtained from the questionnaire used, several households' characteristics were proposed together with consumers' preferences to be considered during the development of feedback. Web based feedback resulted in being the most effective (when compared to display and bills), achieving electricity savings of approximately 15% within households that visited the web-site. The monthly income is amongst the most influential factors determining electricity consumption although only in high and low income groups. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Behavior; Consumer preferences; Energy savings; Feedback; Household characteristics; Monitoring","Energy conservation; Feedback; Monitoring; Behavior; Consumer preferences; Domestic energy consumption; Electricity saving; Electricity-consumption; Household characteristics; Income groups; Influential factors; Socio-economic factor; Web based; Consumer behavior; consumer-resource interaction; data set; electrical power; energy conservation; feedback mechanism; fuel consumption; household energy; household survey; income distribution; monitoring; preference behavior; socioeconomic conditions; trend analysis; Sweden",,,,,"Energimyndigheten","The authors are thankful to the Swedish Energy Agency for the financial support to the research project “Energy in mind”.

Labels are clustered among smaller, post-war homes in neighborhoods with more difficult selling conditions. We also document that geographic variation in the adoption rate of energy labels is positively related to the fraction of ""green"" voters during the 2006 national elections.

Monitoring and reporting of building energy use may induce occupants to conserve energy. The goal of this study was to assess the behavioral impact of providing building occupants with personal electricity utilization data contextualized with different social frames of reference. We installed monitoring equipment on the electrical meters for 83 rooms of a six-floor residential dormitory building and formulated three study groups and a control group from the building occupants. One study group was provided with their own electricity use, a second group was provided their own electricity use contextualized with average building occupant utilization, and a third group was provided with their own electricity use contextualized with both average occupant utilization and the electricity use of their peer network in the building. The only group that significantly reduced their electricity use when compared to the control group was the study group that could view peer network utilization. All three study groups exhibited response-relapse patterns after viewing their electricity consumption raising important questions about the sustainability of energy conservation and monitoring efforts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The ideas behind this mobile phone-based game are twofold; to transform the home environment and its devices into a learning arena for hands-on experience with electricity usage and to promote engagement via a team competition scheme. We report on the game's evaluation with six teenagers and their families who played the game for ten days in two cities in Sweden. Data collection consisted of home energy measurements before, during, and after a game trial, in addition to interviews with participants at the end of the evaluation. The results suggest that the game concept was highly efficient in motivating and engaging the players and their families to change their daily energy-consumption patterns during the game trial. Although the evaluation does not permit any conclusions as to whether the game had any postgame effects on behavior, we can conclude that the pervasive persuasive game approach appears to be highly promising in regard to energy conservation and similar fields or issues. © 2009 ACM.","Automatic meter reading; Energy conservation; Engaging interaction; Feedback; Persuasive games; Pervasive games; Pervasive learning","Automatic meter reading; Consumption patterns; Data collection; Domestic energy; Electricity usage; Energy consumption; Energy measurements; Game approach; Game concept; Hands-on experiences; Home environment; Pervasive game; Pervasive learning; Automation; Electric measuring instruments; Public utilities; Telecommunication equipment; Energy conservation",,,,,,,"B̈ang, M., Svahn, M., Gustafsson, A., Persuasive design of amobile energy conservation game with direct feedback and social cues (2009) Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference of the Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA 2009); B̈ang, M., Gustafsson, A., Katzeff, C., Promoting new patterns in household energy consumption with pervasive learning games (2007) Proceedings of Persuasive 2007, 4744, pp. 55-56. , LNCS, Springer, Berlin; B̈ang, M., Torstensson, C., Katzeff, C., The Power House: A persuasive computer game designed to raise awareness of domestic energy consumption (2006) LNCS, 3962, pp. 123-132. , Springer, Berlin; Benford, S., Rowland, D., Flintham, M., Drozd, A., Hull, R., Reid, J., Morrison, J., Facer, K., Life on the edge: Supporting collaboration in location-based experiences (2005) Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '05), pp. 721-730. , ACM, New York; Forman, G., An extensive empirical study of feature selection metrics for text classification (2003) J.

By comparison analysis of the survey data, major findings are as follows: (1) residential electricity consumption will increase continually in the next years in China, because of the improvement of people's living standard and more dependency on electric appliances; (2) improving occupants' behavior in domestic life can save more than 10% household electricity use; and (3) some effort on residential energy savings should be shifted from technological measures to improving occupants' behavior in ordinary domestic life.

The first study surveyed 810 Californians about energy conservation and found that descriptive normative beliefs were more predictive of behavior than were other relevant beliefs, even though respondents rated such norms as least important in their conservation decisions. Study 2, a field experiment, showed that normative social influence produced the greatest change in behavior compared to information highlighting other reasons to conserve, even though respondents rated the normative information as least motivating. Results show that normative messages can be a powerful lever of persuasion but that their influence is underdetected. © 2008 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Pro-environmental behavior; Social inference; Social influence; Social norms","adult; article; attention; attitude to health; cultural anthropology; decision making; environmental protection; female; human; information processing; male; middle aged; motivation; persuasive communication; social behavior; social psychology; United States; Adult; Attention; California; Conservation of Natural Resources; Culture; Data Collection; Decision Making; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Persuasive Communication; Social Conformity; Social Identification",,,,,,,"Aarts, H., Dijksterhuis, A., The silence of the library: Environment, situational norms, and social behavior (2003) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84, pp. 18-28; Aebischer, V., Hewstone, M., Henderson, M., Minority influence and musical preference: Innovation by conversion not coercion (1984) European Journal of Social Psychology, 14, pp. 23-33; Alvaro, E.M., Crano, W.D., Cognitive responses to minority- or majority-based communications: Factors that underlie minority influence (1996) British Journal of Social Psychology, 35, pp. 105-121; Asch, S.E., Studies of independence and conformity: A minority of one against a unanimous majority (1956) Psychological Monographs, 70, pp. 1-70; Bargh, J.A., Does subliminality matter to social psychology?

Prior studies indicate that information feedback can stimulate resource conservation. College dormitories provide an excellent venue for controlled study of the effects of feedback. The goal of this study is to assess how different resolutions of socio-technical feedback, combined with incentives, encourage students to conserve resources. Design/methodology/ approach - An automated data monitoring system was developed that provided dormitory residents with real-time web-based feedback on energy and water use in two ""high resolution"" dormitories. In contrast, utility meters were manually read for 20 ""low-resolution"" dormitories, and data were provided to residents once per week. For both groups, resource use was monitored during a baseline period and during a two week ""dorm energy competition"" during which feedback, education and conservation incentives were provided. Findings - Overall, the introduction of feedback, education and incentives resulted in a 32 percent reduction in electricity use (amounting to savings of 68,300 kWh, $5,107 and 148,000 lbs of CO-2) but only a 3 percent reduction in water use. Dormitories that received high resolution feedback were more effective at conservation, reducing their electricity consumption by 55 percent compared to 31 percent for low resolution dormitories. In a post-competition survey, students reported that they would continue conservation practices developed during the competition and that they would view web-based real-time data even in the absence of competition. Practical implications - The results of this research provide evidence that real-time resource feedback systems, when combined with education and an incentive, interest, motivate and empower college students to reduce resource use in dormitories. Originality/value - This is the first study to report on the effects of providing college students with real-time feedback on resource use. The authors of this study are currently engaged in further research to determine: whether reductions in consumption can be sustained over time with and without incentives; the degree to which feedback affect attitude; and the degree to which findings are transferable to apartments and other residential settings. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Energy conservation; Energy consumption; Feedback; Incentives (psychology); Internet; Students",,,,,,,,"Brandon, G., Lewis, A., Reducing household energy consumption: A qualitative and quantitative field study (1999) Journal of Environmental Psychology, 19, pp. 75-85; Darby, S., Making it obvious: Designing feedback into energy consumption (2000) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Energy Efficiency in Household Appliances and Lighting, Italian Association of Energy Economists/ EC-SAVE Programme; Evans, G.W., McCoy, J.M., When buildings don't work: The role of architecture in human health (1998) Journal of Environmental Psychology, 18, pp. 85-94; Heede, R., Swisher, J., (2002) Oberlin: Climate Neutral by 2020, , report, Rocky Mountain Institute, Snowmass, CO; Janda, K.B., Payne, C., Kunkle, R., Lutzenhiser, L., What organizations did (and didn't) do: Three factors that shaped conservation responses to California's 2001 'crisis' (2002) Human and Social Dimensions of Energy Use: Understanding Markets and Demand, 8, pp. 117-28. , American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy Washington, DC; Mayer, S.F., Frantz, C.M., The connectedness to nature scale: A measure of individuals' feeling in community with nature (2004) Journal of Environmental Psychology, 24, pp. 503-15; Murray, M., Petersen, J.E., Payback in currencies of energy, carbon dioxide and money for a 60 kW photovoltaic array (2004) Proceedings of the National Solar Energy Conference, American Solar Energy Society, Portland Oregon; Roberts, S., Baker, W., (2003) Towards Effective Energy Information: Improving Consumer Feedback on Energy Consumption, , report, Centre for Sustainable Energy, Bristol; Schipper, L., Linking lifestyle and energy used: A matter of time?

This study focused on the awareness of residents to energy conservation and on the potential of reducing energy demand through energy-saving activities. To carry out quantitative analysis, an on-line interactive ""energy consumption information system"" for motivating energy-saving activities is constructed, and it was installed in nine residential houses. By utilizing data of measured power consumption, ambient and room temperatures before and after installation of the system, and the responses of the residents to the system, its effectiveness was evaluated. Major findings were as follows: (1) installation of the system led to a 9% reduction in power consumption, (2) comparisons of daily-load curves and load-duration curves for each appliance, before and after installation, revealed various energy-saving behaviors of the household members such as the reduction of standby power and better control of appliance operation, and (3) energy-conservation awareness affected not only the power consumption of the appliances explicitly shown on the display monitor, but also other household appliances. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

An on-line interactive ""energy-consumption information system"" that displays power consumptions of, at most, 18 different appliances, power and city-gas consumption of the whole house and room temperature, for the purpose of motivating energy-saving activities has been constructed and the effectiveness of the system investigated by installing it in 10 residential buildings. The experiment showed that energy-saving consciousness was raised and energy consumption was in fact reduced by the energy-saving activities of the household members. In this paper, the system is described in detail and the effectiveness of reducing energy-consumption of the whole house and for space heating will be discussed. Also the energy-saving activities in a certain household are shown by using load duration curves. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

An experimental design was used to study the influence of information leaflets, attunement labels, and socially comparative feedback on the actual levels of energy and water consumption in 166 households over a 6-month period. The results suggest that the labels, designed to attune residents to the environmental-impact affordances of various appliances around their homes, led to a 23% reduction in water consumption. Neither information leaflets nor socially comparative feedback produced significant reductions in water use, compared to controls. No significant reductions in energy consumption were observed for any of the intervention conditions. The results are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications and their application to public policy promoting environmentally sustainable behavior. Copyright © 2005 by V. H.

The EcoTeam Program (ETP) is an intervention package that aims to overcome these flaws. Through a combination of information, feedback, and social interaction in a group-the EcoTeam-participants focus on the environmental consequences of their household behavior. The 3-year longitudinal study found that ETP participants (N = 150) changed half of the 38 household behaviors examined, with corresponding reductions on four physical measures of resource use. These improvements were maintained or enlarged 2 years after completion of the ETP, amounting to savings from 7% on water consumption to 32% on solid waste deposition. A detailed analysis of one behavior, means of transportation, suggests that change can be predicted from the interplay between behavioral intention and habitual performance before participation, and the degree of social influence experienced in the EcoTeam during participation. © 2004 Sage Publications.","Habit; Intention; Intervention; Proenvironmental behavior","environmentalism; household structure; public attitude; resource use",,,,,,,"Aarts, H., Dijksterhuis, A., Habits as knowledge structures: Automaticity in goal-directed behavior (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 53-63; Aarts, H., Verplanken, B., Van Knippenberg, A., Predicting behavior from actions in the past.

The study explored the roles of goals to save energy and kW h feedback. Feedback was given, and conservation goals set, via a simulated, technologically advanced, washing machine control panel. One hundred subjects each completed 20 simulated washing trials. Self-set and assigned goals were compared as to their effect on conservation behavior when used in combination with energy feedback. Both generated similar energy savings with the self-set goal group using 21% less energy than the control group. Social orientation, a personality factor, was found to interact with goal-setting mode, with pro-self individuals saving more energy when allowed to self-set a goal and pro-social individuals saving more energy when assigned a goal. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This article describes applied energy conservation campaigns at two U.S. military installations where residents do not pay their own utility bills. Customized approaches were designed for each installation based on a broad social-psychological model. Before-and-after energy use was measured, and residents were surveyed about end use behaviors. Residents said they were motivated by the desire to do the right thing, set good examples for their children, and have comfortable homes. For sustained change, respondents recommended continued awareness and education, disincentives, and incentives. Findings support some aspects of a social-psychological model, with emphasis on altruistic and egoistic motives for behavioral change. These studies may have implications for situations where residents are not billed for individual energy use, including other government-subsidized facilities, master-metered apartments, and university dormitories.",,"attitudinal survey; conservation planning; energy conservation; public attitude; United States",,,,,,,"Allen, J.B., Ferrand, J.L., Environmental locus of control, sympathy, and proenvironmental behavior (1999) Environment and Behavior, 31 (3), pp. 338-353; Barker, K., Fong, L., Grossman, S., Quin, C., Reid, R., Comparison of self-reported recycling attitudes and behaviors with actual behavior (1994) Psychological Reports, 75 (1), pp. 571-577; Becker, L.J., Seligman, C., Fazio, R.H., Darley, J.M., Relating attitudes to residential energy use (1981) Environment and Behavior, 13 (5), pp. 590-609; Bratt, C., The impact of norms and assumed consequences on recycling behavior (1999) Environment and Behavior, 31 (5), pp. 630-656; Costanzo, M., Archer, D., Aronson, M., Pettigrew, T., Energy conservation behavior: The difficult path from information to action (1986) American Psychologist, 41 (5), pp. 521-528; Darley, J.M., Beninger, J.R., Diffusion of energy-conserving innovations (1981) Journal of Social Issues, 37 (2), pp. 150-171; Deal, B.M., Adams, J.S., Adams, M.H., The green neighborhood process.

Participants (with the exception of the control group) received feedback in various forms, i.e. consumption compared to previous consumption or to similar others; energy saving tips in leaflets or on a computer; or feedback relating to financial or environmental costs. Respondents were interviewed after the start of the study to establish their income, socio-demographic status, environmental attitudes and the extent to which they already engaged in conserving activities. Participants also took part in focus groups after the final meter readings were taken. Overall the results indicated that income and demographic features predicted historic energy consumption but not changes in consumption during the field study, where environmental attitudes and feedback were influential. Of all the feedback groups, the installation of computers helped reduce consumption most markedly. Furthermore, people with positive environmental attitudes, but who had not previously been engaged in many conservation actions, were more likely to change their consumption subsequent to the feedback period.

The same procedure was followed with employees in a second unit, but they also received information about the performance of the first unit. In accordance with predictions from social identity theory and social comparison theory, the results clearly showed that employees in the comparative feedback condition saved more energy than employees who only received information about their own performance, even half a year after the intervention. A remarkable finding was that behavioural change took place with hardly any changes in attitudes or intentions.

In an extensive research project the possibilities for achieving savings in electricity consumption and the barriers to realizing an effective electricity savings policy are investigated. The size of electricity consumption is determined by a wide range of factors in a complex interrelationship. Electricity consumption as a whole can be divided into two parts: socioeconomic and lifestyle. Via a multiple regression analysis it can be seen that 64% of the variations in consumption can be attributed to the socioeconomic part of consumption. Besides differences in socioeconomic characteristics there are also differences in lifestyle which are of importance to both the size of electricity consumption and savings efforts. In the investigation, experience in the empirical context has been gained as to how different combinations of applied measures have resulted in savings. Savings of a magnitude of about 10% can thus be demonstrated. © 1993.","Electricity consumption model; Electricity savings; Experiment","electricity consumption; multiple regression analysis; research project; savings policy; Denmark; Aves",,,,,,,"AKF is the Institute of Local Government Studies, Denmark; Electricity consumption for radiant heating is omitted from the investigation; consumption for other heating purposes (ie circulation pumps, electric water heaters and portable convectors) is included; The correlation between rising GNP and electricity consumption is documented for a number of industrialized countries. See eg Stephen Meyers, Electricity Consumption in 13 Major Developing Countries in 1980–1987, Research note, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, September 1989, and M. Friedrichs and E. Unterwurzacher, ‘International electricity end-use efficiency: an international overview’, Paper presented at the Seminar on Energy Conservation in Nordic Countries, Olson, 23–24 October 1989; For household electric appliances, a saturation point may have been reached which for some appliance types will lead to stagnating or even falling consumption, taking into account the fact that new appliances are more energy effective than old or worn out ones. The reason for constantly rising electricity consumption (although it has stagnated somewhat in the last few years while total personal consumption fell), may be found in the overall increase in appliance stock (more small appliances and the appearance of new appliance types), plus changing utilization requirements for appliance (new and more functions performed with the aid of electric appliances). It is estimated that about half the increase in consumption between 1980 and 1986 can be attributed to greater frequency in use. Additionally, the fact that the size of households in the period in question has decreased is part of the reason for the rising electricity consumption, in that growth in the [[Truncated]]; Heating costs can normally be double the cost of electicity; Heating consumption is closely tied to housing standard, size and external temperature, and is, furthermore, subject to behaviour oriented variations, mainly in connection with the household's comfort standards (room temperature, hot water demand etc). Electricity consumption for appliances is, on the other hand, much less dependent on the house's particular characteristics than it is on the other factors, such as the household's group size, group structure and requirements or lifestyle. Nordstand et al, Salg af kollektiv energi, AKF, 1984, also have reservations about the estimated price elasticities, and conclude that electricity use in heating can be considered much more elastic than in uses for appliances; Ibid; Here, own price elasticity should be understood as a price change confined to the energy form in question. The limited portion of electricity consumption used in Denmark for direct electric heating is, however, included; Mills, (1989) An End-Use Perspective of Electricity Price Responsiveness, pp. A1-A3. , Lund University, Vattenfall, Table A-1; Møller, Udgiffer til eltjenester i boligsektoren (1991) Teknisk Rapport 291, , DEFU; Larsen, Jordal-Joergensen, Joergensen, Nielsen, Perdersen, Togeby, (1993) Virkemidler og elbes pare ser, , See, AKF, Here, it is questioned whether the demand for appliances with better electrical efficiency arose as the result of another demand, ie a desire to reduce energy consumption. Instead, it is assumed that product development in more electrically efficient appliances has come about spontaneously as a result of the general technological development; Op cit. Ref. 9; Ibid, p iii; Ibid, p 122; Experience has shown that when the price of oil is raised by degrees and the rate is slow, there is no effect on consumption;; Willenbourg, Pitts, Gasoline prices their effect on consumer behaviour and attitudes (1977) Journal of Marketing, 41, pp. 24-31. , see; Vattenfall (Païvi Koljonen and Dennis Waltin), (1989) Prisupplevelsesstudie, , Stockholm; Bartlett, Hawk, Schipper, Vine, Linking lifestyles and energy use: a matter of time? (1989) Annual Review and Energy, (14). , The systematization described is discussed in; It is possible that within a household there are individuals with various different motives and value orientations. This can be related to, for example, generation differences in a household. The effect of an applied measure, which is addressed to a household in general way, can therefore easily be weakened by such interdependent differences within the household, and, at worst, not work at all. We have chosen to retain the household as a unit of analysis and have thus debarred ourselves from going more specifically into the social and psychological processes taking place outside the household unit. The lifestyle oriented characteristics which are involved here, will therefore take the household as their level of analysis.This limitation implies an analytical gap which may well be of some importance for the targeting of applied measures. On the other hand, it may be assumed that several common values and attitudes etc exist within a household to justify the [[Truncated]]; Hørjup, (1983) Det glemte folk, , Institut for Folkelivsforskning, Statens Byggeforskningsintitut; Larsen, Wandal, (1988) Privatøkonomien i elbesparelser, , AKF; Besides the limited consumer economic incentives for replacing appliances which are still functioning, environmental resource considerations indicate that replacement should be delayed until old appliances are worn out; The compensatory sums were calculated for each test participant on the basis of the most recent annual bill prior to the start of the experiment. As an extra perk to participants, 5% was added to this consumption so that participants with a consumption increase in the first year, in relation to consumption measured prior to the experiment, would have a neutral costs balance. Furthermore, it was possible for the participants who foresaw an increase in electricity consumption in the first test year, for reasonable or natural reasons (eg increase in family size or house floor area), to have the compensatory sum adjusted accordingly; This relates particularly to two factors. First, it was necessary to ask the potential participants in the tariff test (groups 1 and 2) whether they wished to participate; about two-thirds did. Those who declined to take part in the tests had in the first year an increased consumption averaging upwards of 2%. We are not aware of how these consumers would have reacted if they had been participants — but it may be assumed that the greatest willingness to save was to be found in those who endorsed the experiment. In Table 4, savings percentages in group 1 and 2 are mean values between two percentages, where the highest percentage indicates the savings which would have been achieved if the potential participants who declined to take part had shown the same savings results as the groups actually participating. The lowest percentage expresses the most pessimistic evaluation, where it is assumed that the group which declined participation would have remained [[Truncated]]; It has not been possible with the data available from the experiment to clearly distinguish the two lifestyle groups from each other; The savings achieved are seen as behavioural savings, as it was shown that households, by and large, had the same appliance stock at the start and at the end of the experiment. Furthermore, it was observed that test participants had not purchased more energy saving appliances than the reference group","Nielsen, L.; Lene Nielsen is with the Danish Energy Agency, 11 Landemaerket, DK 1119 Copenhagen K, Denmark",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027749862

The present study tested the hypothesis that effectiveness of energy labels is contingent on consumers' information search and decision strategies. Using an information display board paradigm, participants acquired information and made a decision with respect to refrigerators. For half of the participants energy information was available in the form of a symbolic energy label, whereas for the other half energy use was presented in standard format. Time pressure was manipulated so as to vary participants' information search behavior. i.e., the extent to which participants employed selective rather than consistent search across alternatives. As expected, the symbolic label was only effective (i.e., led to more energy-efficient choices) when participants were unpressured by time. Cognitive response data indicated that energy information is considered less under time pressure. The results suggest that effectiveness of symbolic labels is optimal in relatively simple decision environments. © 1993.",,,,,,,,"* Corresponding 61 5938.

We argue that these results may be misleading because offsetting usage effects are likely to occur both within and among households. Conventional experimental designs capture only net interhousehold usage effects. We propose alternative experimental designs better suited to answering important policy questions. An experiment involving continuous‐display electricity‐use monitors supports our prediction of dissimilar and offsetting behavioral responses among treatment households.

The results indicated that after one program exposure (about 20 minutes), viewers adopted simple strategies modeled in the programs which led to savings of approximately 10% on their home energy use for a substantial part of the cooling and heating season.

Four experimental groups were compared. The 4 groups were as follows: (a) the dissonance plus tips plus feedback group, who were informed of an inconsistency between their previously measured attitudes toward conservation and actual high consumption of electricity; (b) the feedback plus tips group, who were notified that they were high consumers of electricity; (c) the tips-only group, who were sent information on ways to conserve electricity (also sent to Groups 1 and 2); and (d) the control group, who were sent a thank-you letter for participating in the study. It was found, in keeping with bolstering behavior predictions of cognitive dissonance theory, that the dissonance group conserved more electricity than all other groups in the 1st 2-wk measurement period. For the 2nd 2-wk measurement period, the dissonance group differed only from the control group. Self-reported behavior change and number of requests for additional conservation materials were not reliable indicators of actual conservation behavior.

In the Foot-in-the-Door condition this target request was preceded by a more moderate one to answer a short energy conservation questionnaire. Homeowners in the Second Request Only condition simply received the conservation request while those in the First Request Only condition received the questionnaire alone. These groups were compared to a Control group of homeowners who were never asked to comply to either request. The groups did not differ in electricity consumption during the 2 week baseline period or in their percentage change from baseline during the 4 week request period. However, throughout the 12 week follow-up period homeowners in all three request groups consumed significantly less electricity than Controls. In addition, the Foot-in-the-Door group contained significantly more Conservers than any other group. These findings were contrasted with the results of behavioral energy studies emphasizing strong external justifications. The implications of minimal justification techniques for producing long-term maintenance of energy conserving behaviors and for promoting their occurrence across a large population of individuals were also discussed. © 1983.",,,,,,,,,"Arbuthnot, Tedeschi, Wayner, Turner, Kressel, Rush, The induction of sustained recycling behavior through the foot-in-the-door technique (1976) Journal of Environmental Systems, 6, pp. 353-366; Aronson, The psychology of insufficient justification: an analysis of some conflicting data (1966) Cognitive consistency, , S.

The studies assessed the effectiveness of videotape modeling programs that demonstrated these conservation strategies when used alone or combined with daily feedback on electricity use. In the winter, the results indicated that videotape modeling and/or feedback were effective relative to baseline and to a control group in reducing overall electricity use by about 15% and electricity used for heating by about 25%. Hygrothermographs, which accurately and continuously recorded temperature and humidity in the homes, indicated that participants were able to live with no reported loss in comfort and no change in attire at a mean temperature of about 62°F when home and about 59°F when asleep. The results were highly discrepant with prior laboratory studies indicating comfort at 75°F with the insulation value of the clothing worn by participants in this study. In the summer, a combination of strategies designed to keep a home cool with minimal or no air conditioning, in conjunction with videotape modeling and/or daily feedback, resulted in overall electricity reductions of about 15% with reductions on electricity for cooling of about 34%, but with feedback, and feedback and modeling more effective than modeling alone. Despite these electricity savings, hygrothermograph recordings indicated minimal temperature change in the homes, with no change in perceived comfort or clothing worn. The results are discussed in terms of discrepancies with laboratory studies, optimal combinations of video‐media and personal contact to promote behavior change, and energy policies that may be mislabeled as sacrificial and underestimate the effectiveness of conservation strategies such as those investigated in these studies. 1982 Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","comfort; energy conservation; modeling",,,,,,,,"Winett, R.A., Love, S.Q., (1981), The effectiveness of home visits by an energy technician and extension agents in promoting summer electricity conservation.

The present experiment attributes this effect to the presence of both a difficult goal and feedback about performance in relation to that goal. 80 families were asked to set a goal to reduce their residential electricity consumption for several weeks during the summer, half of them by 20% (a difficult goal) and half by 2% (an easy goal). Within each of these groups, half of the families were given feedback 3 times/wk about their consumption. 20 more families served as a control group. As predicted, the 20%-feedback group conserved the most (13.0-25.1%) and was the only one that consumed significantly less electricity than the control. It is concluded that improved performance was a result of the joint effect of feedback and goal setting. The implications of the present research for a national residential conservation strategy are discussed.

The results of two attitudinal surveys demonstrated that homeowners' summer electricity consumption could be predicted from their energy-related attitudes. Personal comfort and health concers were the best predictors of consumption. Psychologically derived techniques to reduce summer electricity consumption were experimentally examined in three separate studies. In study 1, almost daily consumption feedback was found to reduce electricity usage 10.5%. In study 2, subjects receiving frequent feedback, who were also asked to adopt a difficult conservation goal, reduced their electricity consumption 13.0%. In study 3, a device that signaled homeowners when they could cool their houses without air conditioning by opening their windows led to a reduction in consumption of 15.7%. It was concluded that the resident can play an important role in energy conservation that complements engineering solutions. © 1978.",,"BEHAVIORAL ASPECTS; HOUSES",,,,,"EY-76-2-02-2789, DOE, U.S. Department of Energy","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the U.S. Department of Energy, contract number EY-76-2-02-2789.

During experimental conditions, daily prompts (written conservation slogans attached to front doors) and/or daily feedback (daily kilowatts consumed and daily cost information) were in effect. Maximum consumption occurred during the initial baseline; minimum consumption occurred during different experimental conditions for different families. The mean decrease from the maximum to the minimum for all families was 35%. Reversals in consumption were demonstrated in three families, although successive baselines tended to decrease. No clear differences in effectiveness between prompting and feedback conditions were apparent.
